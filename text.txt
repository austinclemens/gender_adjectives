This project started when I read a tweet and got angry. I can’t find the original tweet, but you can guess the content by my response (yes, I was subtweeting[1. Yes, I am a garbage tweeter. You probably shouldn’t follow me <a href=”https://twitter.com/AustinClemens2”>@austinclemens2</a>]):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PSA for people writing: &quot;I&#39;m not sexist, Hillary is just aloof.&quot; That&#39;s a sexist stereotype of powerful women so you&#39;re not helping yourself</p>&mdash; Austin Clemens (@AustinClemens2) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinClemens2/status/778317038905335808">September 20, 2016</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

“But she is aloof,” comes the rejoinder. And look, maybe she is, and I don’t want to prevent anyone from using the full range of the English language, but I personally don't have enough information to make a nuanced character assessment of a woman who I really only know through CNN.[1. Even basically fair characterizations are hard to disentangle from cultural gender biases. Clinton is often called calculating, and that’s certainly the impression her emails give, but ‘calculating’ in this case is basically a euphemism for political triangulation and I’m honestly not sure if I would use the same word to describe a male politician.] It sounds like part of a narrative that lazily ascribes gender stereotypes to a woman who is in the news.

Men are logical, women are emotional. Men are handsome, women are hot/sexy/gorgeous. Women are bright, men are intelligent. So used to them we are unaware of them and then bring in Frum - this just seems blinkered to women - and then maybe have the aside about stereotyping?
